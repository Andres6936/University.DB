# University.DB
Project used to extract information from Colciencias about my university teachers automatically.

A web scraper is a computer program that can be used to extract data from websites.
Scrapers can be used for a variety of purposes, such as collecting data for research,
marketing, or business intelligence.

In this case, we can use a web scraper to collect data about university professors 
from the website Colciencias.gov.co. This website contains information about professors
who have been awarded grants by the Colombian government's science and technology agency,
Colciencias.
